# Description

Horiseon is a webpage I edited to meet accessibility standards.
This was done when I viewed the html source code, then edited elements in html code to make sure it is semantically correct. Also, I reorganized the html structure so that it follows a logical structure. I added accessible alt attributes to images for description purposes incase images do not load on webpage. I modified code to follow sequential order in html and css. I also, consolidated css code to give it minimal redundant values and cleaner look. Finally, I added a descriptive title to the webpage.
